<h1>Edward Hesketh</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! I am Edward Hesketh. I am primarily a programmer, but I love working on both hardware and software projects, and I have a wide range of skills.
    </p>
    <p>
    I can...
        <ul>
            <li>Architect, develop, and publish software - frontend and backend - for computers and microcontrollers</li>
            <li>Design and assemble custom <abbr title="Printed Circuit Boards">PCBs</abbr> using <a href="https://kicad.org">KiCAD</a></li>
            <li>Create 3D parts with <abbr title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</abbr> using <a href="https://freecad.org">FreeCAD</a>, <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/campaigns/fusion-360">Autodesk Fusion 360</a>, or <a href="https://openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a> and manufacture them using lathes, mills, lazer cutting, and 3D-printing.</li>
            <li>Maintain multiple servers to reliably host services using <a href="https://nixos.org">NixOS</a>.</li>
            <li>Automate the building of software using the <a href="https://nixos.org">Nix</a> language.</li>
        </ul> 
    </p>
    <p>
 My faviourite languages to work in when creating software are C and Go, but I have experience in C&#8288;+&#8288;+, C&#8288;#, Typescript/Javascript, Python, and a little Lua.
    </p>
    <p>I enjoy learning about the "secret backend" to the world - finding out about the hidden systems that run everyday things - my favourites being well-made design rules, and interesting/useful datasets (such as National Rail train data). I also have a strong passion for <a href="https://nixos.org">NixOS</a>, which I have used for multple years on all of my computers and servers.
    </p>
    <p>
  When I make things, I try to make them easily maintainable and avoid over-complicating them, after all

        <h2>About me</h2>
    <h3>Origins of a programmer</h3>
    <p>
    When I was in primary school, my dad introduced me to <a href="https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Scratch_2.0">Scratch</a>, and I loved it! I spent hours of my spare time making little fun games out of blocks to play and to show to my friends. I loved solving all of the tiny puzzles that programming brought with it, but I quickly ran into problems when I tried making some of my biggest ideas in Scratch - I came accross all sorts of annoying strangeties in the engine, running into race conditions in a language that was clearly not designed for what I was doing with it. My dad noticed this, and decided to buy me a book about Python, to help me learn how to write real programs. I quickly set off making whatever interested me: (very) basic terminal chatbots, a drawing machine with the python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html">turtle library</a>, basic <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html">tkinter</a> dialogues, all sorts!
    </p>
    <p>
    As I got a little older, my dad helped me learn Go. I made <a href="https://adrianhesketh.com/2019/11/24/alarm-project-pi-go-aws-iot/">a simple door alarm out of a Raspberry Pi Zero W</a> with him, and tried out making <a href="https://github.com/headblockhead/textAdventure">a basic text adventure game</a> with his help too.
    </p>
    <p>
    When COVID hit around the end of my time at primary school, I started learning other programming languages with my dad's help too, making and publishing my first React Native app. But I started looking for more of a challenge. I had heard about an interesting game engine called Unity when watching YouTube, and wanted to try making more advanced games. I independently taught myself Unity through youtube tutorials and pure trial and error, and ended up teaching myself how to program in C&#8288;# too!
    </p>
    <p>
    After COVID, I started writing small amounts of C&#8288;+&#8288;+; wrote games for the <a href="https://play.date">Playdate</a> in Lua, then C (<a href="https://github.com/headblockhead/archery">archery</a>, <a href="https://github.com/a-h/lineman">lineman</a>); continued making games in Unity; discovered the magic of <a href="https://nixos.org">Nix</a>; made my first PCB; tried out making a <a href="https://github.com/headblockhead/picoDoomsdayMessenger">texting device using long-range radio</a>; started version 1 of my Slab keyboard project; and so, so, <em>so</em> much more.
    </p>
    <p>
    All of this leads up to...
    </p>
    <h3>Where I'm at now</h3>
    <p>
        At the moment, I work on personal passion projects in my free time, and as part of <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a> - an international community of teenage hackers. At my school/college I am currently studying for A-Level Computer Science in addition to my GCSEs.
    </p>
    <p>
        </p>
    <p>
        Almost all of my projects since the start are open source, and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/headblockhead">my GitHub</a>. I have made a wide range of different projects, with their quality improving over time as I have improved my skills.
    </p>
    <h2>Flagship projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3><a href="projects/slab">The Slab keyboard</a></h3>
                    <p>A modular mechanical keyboard system that snaps together with magnets. Built from the ground-up with custom circuitboards, brand-new firmware, code-generated 3D-printed cases, and software integration with OpenRGB.</p>
